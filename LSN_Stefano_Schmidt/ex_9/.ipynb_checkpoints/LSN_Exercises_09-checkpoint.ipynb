    "The traveling salesman problem (TSP) consists of a salesman and a set of $N$ cities with positions $\\vec{c}_i$. The salesman **has to visit each one of the cities starting from a certain one (e.g. the hometown) and returning to the same city**. The challenge of the problem is that the traveling salesman wants to **minimize the total length of the trip**.\n",
