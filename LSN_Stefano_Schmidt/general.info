This folder contains the solution to all the exercises proposed in the Numerical Simulation Laboratory in the a.y. 2018/2019.
There is one folder labeled es_* for each of the 12 exercise.
Each folder contains:
	- a Makefile to compile all the relevant code (make is enough to generate file ex_*.exe which solves the exercise)
	- a cpp file ex_*.cpp which holds the solution to the exercise 
	- some eventual additional files that may be required for es_*.cpp to work
	- some output files that are required by the exercise
	- a jupyter file ... which explains how the exercise has been tackled and present the required output of the program
In the main folder there is also a file standard_header.h which keeps together the useful declaration common to all exercises.
In a folder general_code/ there is the definition of some function (all declared in standard_header.h) that are used in some exercises as well as the definition and declaration of class Random to generate random numbers (used in every exercise).
There are two more folders:
	- particle_simulator/: holds definition and declaration of the classe particle_simulator, required to solve easily exercise 4 and exercise 7
	- GA_helper/: holds definition and declaration of class individual_type and some additional functions that are useful to solve the TSP problem, required for exercises 9 and 10
